# Tibia_MG
Tibia NN Monster Generator
## Goals 
1. Perform analysis of the monsters' data
2. Develop a "suggested level" measure to add to data
3. Collect all data into one file
4. Develop a Neural Net to _attempt_ to create new monsters based on input parameters (ex: combat level, race, boss boolean, list of names?)
5. Get a list of generalized monster/enemy names
6. Have the NN predict how the enemy would look, resistances, damage, etc.
